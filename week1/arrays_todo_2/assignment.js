/*
Given a numerical array, reverse the order of values, in-place. 
The reversed array should have the same length, with existing elements moved to other indices 
so that order of elements is reversed. Working 'in-place' means that you cannot use a second 
array â€“ move values within the array that you are given. As always, 
do not use built-in array functions such as splice().

/*
Implement rotateArr(arr, shiftBy) that accepts array and offset. 
Shift arr's values to the right by that amount. 
'Wrap-around' any values that shift off array's end to the other side, so that no data is lost. 
Operate in-place: given ([1,2,3],1), 
change the array to [3,1,2]. Don't use built-in functions.
Second: allow negative shiftBy (shift L, not R).
Third: minimize memory usage. With no new array, handle arrays/shiftBys in the millions.
Fourth: minimize the touches of each element.
